    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    
    
    
    <div>
        <p>I’m Lukas, a student at a prestigous university: Purdue University, where I study computer engineering while specializing in embedded systems, digital electronics, and low-level software development. My work lives at the intersection of hardware and software, from reverse engineering iOS to programming FPGAs and designing full-stack embedded systems.</p>
<p>I also work part-time at my family’s logistics company, where I handle systems integration and operations. Basically, I make sure the tech, warehouse, and office all speak the same language as well as automate what I can along the way.</p>
<p>I’m originally from Chicago, but I bounce between South Florida, West Lafayette, and wherever else I feel like going. Outside of class and projects, I’m into F1, coffee, music, and figuring out how stuff works just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>I started a phone repair business back in highschool (2018-19) fixing a variety of iPhones and Android devices. During Covid, I had to find my calling, and what I was good at, and my whole interest in computer engineering started with cracking open iPhones and Android devices on my bedroom desk and launching a small-scale phone repair business. Screen replacements, battery swaps, logic board rework, water damage fixes. If it was broken, I was fixing it. I taught myself how to microsolder, sourced parts, ran repairs out of my room, and took walk-ins through DMs and word of mouth. What started as a hustle turned into a mini operation, and more importantly, a launchpad into real engineering. That hands-on experience: breaking stuff, fixing it, and understanding how every component fits together, shaped the way I approach engineering today: directly, precisely, and with zero fear of failure.</p>
<p>Outside coursework, I&rsquo;ve been involved in hands-on projects that span circuit design, microcontroller programming, systems integration, network engineering and iOS reverse engineering/modification. I&rsquo;m constantly exploring new technologies and refining my skils.</p>
