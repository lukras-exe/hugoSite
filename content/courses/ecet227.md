ECET 227 focueses on the analysis and application of alternating current (AC) electrical circuits, which are fundamental to modern electronics and electrical systems. Topics include capacitors, inductors, oscillators, rectifiers, bipolar and MOSFET power switches, switching power supplies, half- and full-H bridges, switching audio amplifiers, and linear voltage regulators. Through out my time in this course, we gained hands on experience using computer-aided tools for circuit simulation (Multisim) and analysis, developing a strong understanding of how electronic systems are designed, optimized, and implemented in real-world applications.
