In this course, I developed a strong foundation in design and analysis of concurrent digital systems using FPGA development boards and utilizing the Quartus simulation software. I learned how to describe digital circuit behavior using various methods and how to translate between them. We explored both combinational and sequential logic, and I worked hands-on with key building blocks like multiplexers, flip-flops, and counters. Using computer-aided design tools and programmable logic devices, I designed, simulated, and tested digital circuits. The course emphasized real-world implementation, allowing me to apply concepts to build reliable and efficient digital subsystems.
