### Overview
CNIT 255 introduced core principles of modern software development through the lens of object-oriented programming (OOP). The course provided hands-on experience with foundational OOP concepts and guided students through the complete software development lifecycle — from algorithmic problem-solving and interface design to testing, debugging, and database integration.

### Key Concepts Covered
- Core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Control structures: decisions, loops, and intermediate data types
- Modular design using methods, arrays, and collections
- Robust exception handling and fault tolerance
- Persistent data handling and DBMS (Database Management System)connectivity
- User interface construction for interactive applications
- Collaborative software development and team-based programming
- Fundamentals of software testing and debugging best practices

This course helped sharpen my understanding of application logic, code design patterns, and the importance of clean, maintainable code — laying the groundwork for more advanced software engineering and systems programming work.
