## Overview
This implementation establishes reliable UART protocol communication to control and display content on the LCD screen with real-time user input. This project demostrates complete serial communication implementation between an ATMega2560 microcontroller and an LCD display using the UART protocol. The system provides a practical example of embedded programming concepts through interactive working program interfaces that responds to user input via pushbuttons.

## Features
#### Core Functionality
- LCD initialization and configuration
- Serial communications via UART
- Button debouncing and input processing
- Custom character display
#### Demonstration Examples
For this specific project, this includes two example applications to showcase the systems capabilities:
1. **Fortune Teller**: Generates random responses on button press, displaying one of four possible messages
2. **Dice Simulator**: Simulates rolling two dice with ASCII art respresentation of dice faces
