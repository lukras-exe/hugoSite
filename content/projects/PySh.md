**PySh** (Python shell) is a simple command-line shell implemeted in Python. The idea for it was to replicate the Unix-like shells such as Bash or Zsh, while supporting all basic shell commands.

This side project started while I was away in Lithuania for an internship opportunity as a network and security operations engineer. I needed to brush up on my skills with python so I decided to start this. I've learned a lot about the python language and the documentation itself, as well as importing libraries.

## Features

-  **Basic Shell Operations**: Navigate directories, list files, and manage the filesystem.
- **Pipe Support**: Chain commands together using the pipe operator (`|`)
- **Built-in Commands**: Essential commands implemented natively in Python
- **External Command Support**: Execute commands and programs
-  **Cross Platform**: Works on *Windows*, *macOS*, and *Linux*
